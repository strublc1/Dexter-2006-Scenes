# Dexter-2006-Scenes
This replication package is for my final project in Statistics for Social Scientists, in which I analyzed different elements of scenes in the first season of the show Dexter. My analysis focussed on variables including the number of Dexter’s inner thoughts, dead bodies, and detectives, as well as other attributes such as lighting, tension, and gruesomeness of a scene. 


Instructions:

To access and utilize the package, open the “STA215-Struble.R” file containing the code used for my analysis. The raw data being analyzed can be found by opening the “raw_data.csv” file.


Data:

The data collected for this analysis are the scenes from the episodes of the first season of the television series Dexter. I went through the episodes in order, using location changes and time jumps to determine where each scene started and ended. While watching, I noted the number of characters, Dexter’s inner thoughts, dead bodies, blood samples, and interactions with his sister. I also recorded the scene duration, how long Dexter was on screen, and factors such as location, tension, romance, happiness, gruesomeness, funniness, lighting, whether or not there was a crime, and if so, were there detectives and was it solved. This resulted in 17 unique variables and a total of 147 observations from the first season of the show.

The question being asked was what elements of the show's narrative complexity or position as a crime drama caused such a positive reaction with viewers.
