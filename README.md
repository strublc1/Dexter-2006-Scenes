# Dexter-2006-Scenes
This replication package is for my final project in Statistics for Social Scientists, in which I analyzed different elements of scenes in the first season of the show Dexter. My analysis focussed on variables including the number of Dexter’s inner thoughts, dead bodies, and detectives, as well as other attributes such as lighting, tension, and gruesomeness of a scene. 


Instructions:

To access and utilize the package, open the “STA215-Struble.R” file containing the code used for my analysis. The raw data being analyzed can be found by opening the “raw_data.csv” file.


Data:

The data collected for this analysis are the scenes from the episodes of the first season of the television series Dexter. I went through the episodes in order, using location changes and time jumps to determine where each scene started and ended. While watching, I noted the number of characters, Dexter’s inner thoughts, dead bodies, blood samples, and interactions with his sister. I also recorded the scene duration, how long Dexter was on screen, and factors such as location, tension, romance, happiness, gruesomeness, funniness, lighting, whether or not there was a crime, and if so, were there detectives and was it solved. This resulted in 17 unique variables and a total of 147 observations from the first season of the show. The six I included in the replication package are the number of Dexter’s inner thoughts, dead bodies, and characters, as well as other attributes such as lighting, tension, and gruesomeness of a scene. 

The question being asked was what elements of the show's narrative complexity or position as a crime drama caused such a positive reaction with viewers.


Operationalization

The concept of Dexter’s inner thoughts was operationalized by making it into a quantitative variable where each observation (each inner thought) was differentiated by either a temporal gap between thoughts or a shift in the topic being discussed.

The concept of dead bodies was ope	rationalized by making it into a quantitative variable where the number of bodies was counted, with no individual counted more than once.

The concept of characters was operationalized by making it into a quantitative variable where each character was counted as they appeared in a scene, with each character counted only once. The characters being counted were limited to characters that contributed to the plot, and background characters were ignored.

The concept of lighting was operationalized by making lighting a categorical variable with 5 different levels: very dark, dark, neutral, light, and very light. The inclusion of 5 categories was to help deal with slight variations in light levels as to minimize inconsistencies in data collection that may have been present if there were fewer categories.

The concept of tension was operationalized by making tension a categorical variable with 3 categories: low, moderate, and high tension. Tension was assessed based on the tone, interactions, mood, and overall context of the scene within the show

The concept of gruesomeness was operationalized by making gruesomeness as a binary variable (yes or no) to answer the question: Was the scene gruesome? Gruesomeness was solely judged on the presence of gore in the scene.
